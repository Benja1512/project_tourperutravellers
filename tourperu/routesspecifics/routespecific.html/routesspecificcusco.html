            <p><img class="imagen" src="./fotosroutespecific/cusco/cusco1.png" alt="">
              We leave Cusco very early in the morning
              for our three -hour trip by private
              transport to the small town of Tinqui
              (3,800 meters/12,464 feet). As Tinqui is
              located on the new interoceanic road, it
              can now be much faster than in previous years. We pass
              through beautiful landscapes and several traditional
              peoples such as Urcos, Cattca and Ocangate. After lunch
              in Tinqui, the first 3 hours of the road are wonderful
              prelude to the
              magnificent landscape of the Vilcanota
              mountain range, with excellent views of
              Ausangate. We will walk two more hours until
              we reach the hot springs in Upis (4,400
              meters/14,432 feet), which offer fantastic
              views of Ausangate at the end of the valley. We will camp here at night (4-5
              hours of trekking).

              In the morning we will cross the ABRA
              de Arapa (4,850 meters/ 15,908 feet).
              From here, we continue 3 and a half
              hours descending through the valley,
              passing through the green lagoon of
              Puqa q’ocha until we reach the
              Turquoan waters of the Jatun Puqa q’ocha lagoon.
              Next, we will upload the second open of Apuchata
              (4,900 meters / 16,072 feet), with a view to the
              impressive Ausangate Q’ocha lagoon and its
              turquoise blue waters. This lagoon feeds on the
              snow that melts from the . We will camp here the second night.

              From the lagoon we ascend to the Abra Palomani
              (5,200 meters/ 17,056 feet) - the highest point of
              the walk. From the Abra we follow the path to the
              valley where we can rest and have lunch. In the afternoon you can enjoy the
              views of the snowfall three peaks and Punta Puca. We will continue through the
              wide green valley of Pampa Jutunpata and above through the Q’ampa River
              valley. We will spend the third night in this area.

              After passing through the small community of Q’ampa we will head northwest to
               the last pass of this hike – Q’ampa Pass (5,000 meters/16,400 feet).
                We will see several lagoons of different colors and we will have lunch 
                next to Q'oma Q'ocha. We will walk for several hours before reaching the 
                small town of Pacchanta. We can enjoy the hot springs for a couple of
                 hours and even have a well-deserved beer! We will set up camp near 
                 Pacchanta and have the afternoon free to explore this interesting Andean
                  town. (You have the option of staying in a basic hostel tonight).
