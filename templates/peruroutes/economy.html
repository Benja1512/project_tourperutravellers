                    1. Mining and Natural Resources
                    Mining is a cornerstone of Peru's economy, significantly contributing to GDP and exports as a leading global producer of copper, gold, silver, and zinc. While it attracts foreign investment and creates jobs, the sector faces environmental and social concerns, prompting a shift towards sustainable practices amid rising global demand for minerals.

                    2. Agriculture and Agribusiness
                    Peru's agricultural sector boasts diverse production, ranging from traditional crops like potatoes and corn to high-value exports such as avocados, grapes, and coffee. While the country excels in organic farming and sustainable practices, it faces challenges such as climate change, land degradation, and the need for better infrastructure and market access.                </p>

                    3. Economic Growth and Inequality
                    Peru has experienced significant economic growth, often exceeding 5% annually over the past two decades, primarily driven by mining, agriculture, and services. However, persistent income inequality and poverty, particularly in rural and indigenous communities, highlight the need for policies that promote inclusive growth and improve social services.                </p>
