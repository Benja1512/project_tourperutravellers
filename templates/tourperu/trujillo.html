                Trujillo is located on the northern coast of Peru, approximately 550 kilometers
                (about 342 miles) northwest of Lima, the capital city. Nestled along the banks 
                of the Moche River, it is known for its rich history and vibrant culture. 
                The city serves as a gateway to several important archaeological sites, including
                the ancient Moche and Chimu civilizations. Notable nearby attractions include
                the iconic Huacas del Sol y de la Luna, which showcase the impressive artistry 
                and architectural prowess of the Moche culture, and the ruins of Chan Chan, 
                the largest adobe city in the world. With its beautiful colonial architecture, 
                bustling plazas, and close proximity to the Pacific Ocean, Trujillo is a fascinating
                destination for travelers interested in history and culture.
